I’m an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I am a co-director of the [Social Media Analysis and Support for Humanity (SMASH)](https://smash.inf.ed.ac.uk) group. My research focuses on computational approaches to understand and counter social media manipulation. I’m also interested in understanding and describing humans' interactions with each other on social media platforms and with the platforms themselves. I use a combination of security, data science and computational social science methods to conduct my research.

I am looking for PhD students to work with in the academic year of 2024-2025. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in working with me: tugrulcanelmas at gmail.com

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Indiana University at Bloomington working with Prof. Dr. Filippo Menczer and Prof. Dr. Alessandro Flammini at Observatory on Social Media (OSOME). I received my Ph.D. from EPFL, under supervision of Prof. Dr. Karl Aberer in 2022, and my B.S. from Bilkent University in 2017, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
