## About Me

I am currently on the 2022-2023 academic job market.

Hi, I am a 5th Ph.D. student working in the field of Social Media Manipulation at LSIR, EPFL, Switzerland, supervised by Prof. Karl Aberer. My research focuses on understanding the characteristics of bots and fake accounts and the specific strategies they employ to manipulate social media. I'm also interested in analysing such adversaries' impact and building solutions against them. I mainly employ data science techniques in my research.

Before coming to EPFL, I was an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Bilkent University, where I had to chance to work in CicekLab with Prof. Ercüment Çiçek to help building Database of Reconstructed Metabolic Networks (DORMAN). I also spent a summer in Intelligent User Interfaces lab, worked with Prof. Metin Sezgin on the iMotion project.

I'm also the - now deanonimized - author of popular blog https://azimliyazar.blogspot.com
My DMs are always open! If you are a student looking for professional advice, feel free to email me: tugrulcanelmas@gmail.com
